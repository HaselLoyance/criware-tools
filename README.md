# criware-tools
Tools for working with Criware PSP games in the SciAdv series.

#### Tools
- [topographer](https://github.com/HaselLoyance/criware-tools/tree/master/topographer)
This is a tool for extracting strings from the BIN files of the PSP SciAdv games. The name `topographer` comes from the synonym to the word `Cartographer`, which is "a program designed to extract the script(s) from a file and dump them in such a way as to be easily inserted using Atlas" [(source)](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/647/).
- More will be added once I get around to rewriting them to be user-friendly.
